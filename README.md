# Odoo Sales Process Implementation for Mytek

## Overview
This repository contains the project report and its LaTeX source code for the implementation of a sales process using Odoo ERP, modeled after the Tunisian e-commerce company Mytek. The project was developed as part of an academic assignment at the **Institut International de Technologie à Sfax** under the supervision of **Dr. Mohamed MANAA** during the 2024/2025 academic year.

The project focuses on:
- Replicating Mytek's e-commerce interface within Odoo.
- Integrating a local payment solution (Konnect) tailored to the Tunisian market.
- Automating and optimizing the sales process using Odoo's modular ecosystem.

## Repository Contents
